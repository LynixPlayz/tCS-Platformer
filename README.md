# theCoderSchool Frisco Coaches' Project (August 2022 Coder Fair)

Welcome to the repository for the platformer game developed by the coaches at theCoderSchool Frisco!

You should almost always work on your own branch and merge into `main` when ready. Make sure to push/pull frequently.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repo. You can do with GitHub Desktop or via `git clone` with HTTPS or SSH.
2. Install all necessary Python modules. A `requirements.txt` file is provided to make this easy.

    Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    When you are developing this project, feel free to rely on additional third party modules, but please make sure you
    include the correct package names in `requirements.txt` as well when you do that.

    You can rerun this command anytime - it should ensure that you have all the dependencies needed to run the project.
